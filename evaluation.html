								<h1>PSNR and SSIM</h1>
							</header>
							<p>Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation. Because many signals have a very wide dynamic range, PSNR is usually expressed as a logarithmic quantity using the decibel scale.

								PSNR is commonly used to quantify reconstruction quality for images and video subject to lossy compression.
								PSNR is most easily defined via the mean squared error (MSE). Given a noise-free m√ón monochrome image I and its noisy approximation K, MSE is defined as
								PSNR is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstruction of lossy compression codecs (e.g., for image compression). The signal in this case is the original data, and the noise is the error introduced by compression. When comparing compression codecs, PSNR is an approximation to human perception of reconstruction quality.

								Typical values for the PSNR in lossy image and video compression are between 30 and 50 dB, provided the bit depth is 8 bits, where higher is better. The processing quality of 12-bit images is considered high when the PSNR value is 60 dB or higher.[3][4] For 16-bit data typical values for the PSNR are between 60 and 80 dB.[5][6] Acceptable values for wireless transmission quality loss are considered to be about 20 dB to 25 dB.[7][8]

								In the absence of noise, the two images I and K are identical, and thus the MSE is zero.

								The structural similarity index measure (SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a full reference metric; in other words, the measurement or prediction of image quality is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.
