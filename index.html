									<h2><a href="#">Abstract</a></h2>
									<p>Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of
										single image super-resolution using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks, one central problem remains
										largely unsolved: how do we recover the finer texture details
										when we super-resolve at large upscaling factors? The
										behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is
										principally driven by the choice of the objective function.
										Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean
										squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have
										high peak signal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking
										high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in
										the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at
										the higher resolution. In this paper, we present SRGAN,
										a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image superresolution (SR). To our knowledge, it is the first framework
										capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4×
										upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a perceptual
										loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a
										content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to
										the natural image manifold using a discriminator network
										that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved
										images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we
										use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead
										of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network
										is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily
										downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive
										mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant
										gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN. The MOS scores
										obtained with SRGAN are closer to those of the original
										high-resolution images than to those obtained with any
										state-of-the-art method.
										
										Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are an alternate way of estimating generative models via an
										adversarial process where a game theoretic approach is involved to learn to generate from the training
										distribution through minimax two-player game. As a part of my initial contributions to this project, I
										had also implemented a vanilla GAN[1] to generate handwritten digits from a noisy latent space. Single
										image super-resolution (SISR) has been a notoriously challenging ill-posed problem, which aims to obtain
										a high-resolution output from one of its low-resolution versions. Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy
										and speed of SISR using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks (CNN), one central problem to
										recover the finer texture details super-resolving at large upscaling factors remains largely unsolved. With
										this motivation, I have attempted to implement the idea proposed by Christian Ledig et al.[3] to use a
										GAN comprising of deep convolutional networks for upscaling (4× factor) natural images to produce the
										then state-of-the-art photo-realistic super-resolved images.
